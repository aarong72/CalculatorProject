# CalculatorProject
Python Calculator
This calculator was built with Python and tkinter. The application should pull from an API that provides a fact about a number. The fact should be unique and it should also display whether the number is a prime number. The prime number function was created by me alongwith all other functions. 

There is a journal in this repository which details the progress and thought process I went through while creating this project.
